In React Router Dom v6, if you have a nested route setup like this:

```jsx
<Route path="/" element={<Layout><Outlet /></Layout>}>
  <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
</Route>
```

And you try to access a nested route directly (e.g., `/dashboard`) without the parent route (`/`), the `Outlet` component might not render the nested route correctly. This is because React Router needs to render the parent route (`/`) before rendering nested routes, but when accessing `/dashboard` directly, it skips the parent route, leading to an empty Outlet.
